# Sorting Visualizer - Java GUI Project
## Introduction
Sorting Visualizer is a Java-based application that provides an engaging way to visualize various sorting algorithms through a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is designed to help users understand how different sorting algorithms function by animating their step-by-step processes.

## Features
User-Friendly GUI: A modern and intuitive interface that allows users to interact with sorting algorithms visually.

Supported Algorithms: The visualizer includes several sorting algorithms such as:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
  
Real-Time Animation: Observe the sorting process as it happens, with real-time updates for each step of the algorithm.

Customizable Speed: Adjust the animation speed to slow down or speed up the sorting process according to your preference.

## Getting Started
To set up and run the Sorting Visualizer project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Retrieve the project files by cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/NupurVasistha/Sorting-Visualizer.git
Open the Project: Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports Java, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, to open the project.

Run the Application: Locate the main Java file in the project directory and execute it. This will launch the Sorting Visualizer GUI.

How to Use
Launch the application to access the Sorting Visualizer GUI.

Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.

Use the speed control slider to adjust the animation speed.

Click the "Visualize" button to start the sorting animation. The visualizer will demonstrate the algorithmâ€™s steps in real-time.

Watch the elements being sorted and observe the changes as the algorithm processes the data.

Experiment with different algorithms and input data to see how various sorting methods perform.
